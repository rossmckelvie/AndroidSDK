## Accepting New SDK Licenses
Update the script `android-sdk/license_acceptor.sh` with the latest agreement
checksums. Do not change the order or remove pre-existing license agreement
acceptances.

If a new agreement is accepted, a file should be created in the directory
[`EULA`](./EULA). If there is an update, ensure the agreements contain a suffix
with the timestamp in the format `-YYYYMMDD`.
